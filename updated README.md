# TITLE: REDBUS DATA SCRAPING  WITH SELENIUM AND FILTERING WITH STREAMLIT APPLICATION


This project demonstrates a complete workflow involving data scraping, storage, and visualization.  Data is extracted from the REDBUS website using Selenium, stored in a MySQL database, and visualized through an interactive Streamlit application.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
1. DATA SCRAPING:

   It performed  using Selenium in a Jupyter Notebook environment to ensure efficient data 
   extraction.
   Data includes travel details like route name, bus type, price range, star rating and other 
   relevant information.
   
3. DATABASE STORAGE:

   The extracted data is saved in a MySQL database, ensuring structured storage and access the 
   data.

5. VISUALIZATION:

   The data is visualized and filtered using streamlit, providing an interactive front-end for 
   users to explore the dataset.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:

Python, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL.

## Updated Feature Description:

The application now includes the following features for easy access and filtering of bus details:

### State-Based Filtering:

Users can select a specific state to view bus routes and details available for that state.

### Bus Category Filtering:

Users can choose between Government Buses and Private Buses for better customization.

### Bus Type Filtering:

Users can filter buses based on their type, such as:
AC (Air-Conditioned)
Non-AC (Non-Air-Conditioned)
Sleeper
Seater
These filters allow users to narrow down their search and easily find the buses that best meet their travel preferences.

## TO RUN:
Anaconda Prompt for run the python file.
